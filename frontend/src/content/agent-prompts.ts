## Step 1: Follow the Dynamic Apps host architecture

Read the Dynamic Apps quickstart and deployment guidance before changing the project:

- https://rivet.dev/dynamic-apps/docs/quickstart/
- https://rivet.dev/dynamic-apps/docs/deploy/
- https://rivet.dev/dynamic-apps/docs/connect/

The host is a normal Hono server. Mount the private Rivet callback with \`appsRouter.fetch\`, route deployed applications under \`/apps\`, and call \`deployApp()\` only from trusted server-side code. Generated applications default-export a Fetch handler; they must not call \`serve()\`, \`listen()\`, or \`registry.start()\`.

## Step 2: Create a production Dockerfile

If the project does not already have a Dockerfile, add one that installs dependencies, builds the host, exposes port 3000, and starts the Hono server. Adjust the package manager, build output, and entrypoint to match the project:

\`\`\`dockerfile
FROM node:24-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci

COPY . .
RUN npm run build --if-present

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
\`\`\`

If the project does not already have a \`.dockerignore\`, create one that excludes \`node_modules/\`, \`dist/\`, \`.env\`, and \`.git/\`.

## Step 3: Deploy the Dynamic Apps host

Deploy to the \`${namespace}\` namespace and pass the Cloud API token to the running host. \`deployApp()\` needs \`RIVET_CLOUD_TOKEN\` to create and manage the isolated namespace for each generated app:

\`\`\`bash
npx @rivetkit/cli deploy --token "${cloudToken}" --namespace ${namespace} --env PORT=3000 --env RIVET_CLOUD_TOKEN="${cloudToken}"
\`\`\`

Keep the token server-side. Do not expose it to generated app code or browser bundles.

${mcpSection}## Step 4: Verify the host and a deployed app

1. Confirm the host is live at \`${rivetRunUrl}\`.
2. Deploy a small generated app with \`deployApp({ appId: "onboarding", files })\`.
3. Open \`${rivetRunUrl}apps/onboarding/\` and verify the app responds successfully. Preserve the trailing slash.
4. If deployment fails, run \`npx @rivetkit/cli logs --namespace ${namespace}\` and fix the host before retrying.

Report the host URL, app URL, commands run, and any remaining setup the user must complete.`;
}

function getWorkflowsComputeAddendum({
	cloudToken,
	namespace,
	rivetRunUrl,
	mcpSection,
}: Pick<ComputePromptOptions, "cloudToken" | "namespace" | "rivetRunUrl"> & {
	mcpSection: string;
}) {
	return `# Rivet Workflows Compute Deployment Steps

## Step 1: Preserve the Workflows application

Read the Workflows quickstart before changing the project: https://rivet.dev/workflows/docs/quickstart/

Keep the project's \`@rivet-dev/workflows\` workflow definitions, \`setup({ use: { ... } })\` registry, stable \`ctx.step(...)\` names, and existing workflow host entrypoint. External side effects and nondeterministic work must stay inside named steps so retries remain durable. Do not rewrite the project as a generic Rivet Actor example.

## Step 2: Create a production Dockerfile

\`npx @rivetkit/cli deploy\` builds the project from a \`Dockerfile\`. If the project does not already have one, add one that installs dependencies, builds the application, exposes port 3000, and starts the project's existing workflow host. Adjust the package manager, build output, and entrypoint to match the project:

\`\`\`dockerfile
FROM node:24-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci

COPY . .
RUN npm run build --if-present

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
\`\`\`

If the project does not already have a \`.dockerignore\`, create one that excludes \`node_modules/\`, \`dist/\`, \`.env\`, and \`.git/\`.

## Step 3: Deploy the workflow host

Deploy to the \`${namespace}\` namespace:

\`\`\`bash
npx @rivetkit/cli deploy --token "${cloudToken}" --namespace ${namespace} --env PORT=3000
\`\`\`

The CLI caches the Cloud API token in \`~/.rivet/credentials\`, so later deploy and logs commands can omit \`--token\`. Keep the token out of source files and browser bundles.

${mcpSection}## Step 4: Verify the workflow end-to-end

1. Confirm the workflow host is live with \`curl ${rivetRunUrl}api/rivet/health\` (expects a 200).
2. Point the project's existing typed \`rivetkit/client\` client at \`${rivetRunUrl}api/rivet\`, then use \`getOrCreate\` with a workflow key.
3. Invoke the workflow's real action or queue and confirm its expected state or named step result. Do not replace this with a generic actor creation check.
4. If deployment or execution fails, run \`npx @rivetkit/cli logs --namespace ${namespace}\` and consult https://rivet.dev/workflows/docs/failure-and-recovery/ before retrying.

Report the workflow host URL, command used, action or queue invoked, observed result, and any remaining setup the user must complete.`;

	return `# Compute Deployment Steps

## Prerequisites

\`@rivetkit/cli deploy\` builds the image with \`docker buildx\`, so Docker is required. Check it first:

\`\`\`bash
docker buildx version
\`\`\`

If that fails, stop and tell the user to install Docker Desktop (or the Docker engine with the buildx plugin) before continuing. Do not attempt the deploy without it.

## Step 1: Load the RivetKit docs

Read https://rivet.dev/llms.txt to understand how RivetKit works (actors, state, events, actions, connections, clients).

Add a note to the project's \`CLAUDE.md\` / \`AGENTS.md\` (create one if missing) linking to https://rivet.dev/llms.txt as the reference for future RivetKit work.

## Step 2: Keep registry.start() (serverless is automatic)

Do **not** rewrite the project into a hand-mounted HTTP handler. Keep the existing \`registry.start()\` call as-is.

When the app runs on Rivet Compute, Compute automatically runs it in serverless mode (it sets \`RIVETKIT_RUNTIME_MODE=serverless\` for you). In that mode \`registry.start()\` binds an HTTP listener instead of opening a long-lived connection to the engine, so no manual Hono handler is needed. The client API is still served under \`/api/rivet\`, so a frontend served from the same origin should target that mount path:

\`\`\`ts
const client = createClient(location.origin + "/api/rivet");
\`\`\`

Once deployed, the app is publicly reachable at its Rivet Run URL, \`${rivetRunUrl}\`. An external client (not served from the same origin) connects to the actor API at \`${rivetRunUrl}api/rivet\`.

**Serving a frontend:** \`registry.start()\` serves static files automatically. Put the frontend build output in a \`public/\` directory and it is served with zero extra wiring. If the build outputs somewhere else (e.g. \`dist/\`), set \`RIVETKIT_PUBLIC_DIR\` to that directory.

See https://rivet.dev/docs/general/runtime-modes for local vs. serverless modes and https://rivet.dev/docs/connect/rivet-compute for the full Compute integration guide.

## Step 3: Create Dockerfile

\`npx @rivetkit/cli deploy\` builds your project from a \`Dockerfile\`. If the project does not already have one, create it. Use this as a starting point and adjust the package manager (npm/pnpm/yarn), file paths, and entrypoint to match the project. Make sure the frontend build lands in \`public/\` (or set \`RIVETKIT_PUBLIC_DIR\`), and that the entrypoint calls \`registry.start()\`:

\`\`\`dockerfile
FROM node:24-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci

COPY . .
RUN npm run build --if-present

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
\`\`\`

Do **not** set \`RIVETKIT_RUNTIME_MODE\` in the Dockerfile. Compute injects it at deploy time.

If the project does not already have a \`.dockerignore\`, create one:

\`\`\`
node_modules/
dist/
.env
.git/
\`\`\`

Build and run the image to verify it works before deploying. Pass \`-e RIVETKIT_RUNTIME_MODE=serverless\` to simulate how Compute runs it (otherwise the container defaults to engine/envoy mode and the check is not representative). Run it detached so the check does not block on a foreground container:

\`\`\`bash
docker build -t rivet-test .
docker run -d --name rivet-test -p 3000:3000 -e RIVETKIT_RUNTIME_MODE=serverless rivet-test
for i in $(seq 1 30); do curl -sf http://localhost:3000/api/rivet/health && break; sleep 1; done
docker logs rivet-test
docker rm -f rivet-test
\`\`\`

If the health check never succeeds, read \`docker logs rivet-test\` and fix the image before deploying. Always remove the container afterwards so the port is free.

## Step 4: Deploy with the Rivet CLI

Deploy the project with a single command. \`@rivetkit/cli\` builds the \`Dockerfile\`, pushes the image to Rivet's registry, and creates/updates the \`default\` managed pool. Always pass \`--namespace ${namespace}\` so the deploy targets this namespace and not the default \`production\` namespace. The project and organization are auto-detected from the token:

\`\`\`bash
npx -y @rivetkit/cli deploy --yes --token "${cloudToken}" --namespace ${namespace} --env PORT=3000
\`\`\`

Notes:
- The image is built for \`linux/amd64\`. \`--env PORT=3000\` tells Rivet Compute which port to route to. \`registry.start()\` binds the port from \`RIVET_PORT\` (default 3000), so the two line up by default. To use a different port, set both \`--env PORT=<port>\` and \`--env RIVET_PORT=<port>\` to the same value and update the \`EXPOSE\` line to match. Setting \`PORT\` alone does not change the port the app listens on.
- \`--token\` is the \`cloud_api_*\` Cloud API token. The command also caches it to \`~/.rivet/credentials\`, so later \`deploy\` calls can omit \`--token\`.
- \`--yes\` skips the deploy confirmation prompt and \`npx -y\` skips npx's install prompt. Both are required when running non-interactively.

When the command finishes successfully, proceed to Step 5 to verify the deployment is live.

${mcpSection}## Step 5: Verify Deployment

**Token types used in this step:**
- \`cloud_api_*\` is the \`--token\` passed to \`@rivetkit/cli deploy\`, cached in \`~/.rivet/credentials\`. It is a management token scoped to the Cloud API (cloud-api.rivet.dev). The CLI uses it for logs.
- \`pk_*\` is the publishable token below, a public key scoped to the Rivet Engine API (api.rivet.dev). Use this for creating actors and calling gateway endpoints.

These are different tokens with different scopes. Do not mix them up. A 401 in this step is almost always a swapped token type, not a wrong URL.

If the publishable token below reads literally \`<PUBLISHABLE_TOKEN>\`, no token was available when this prompt was generated. Stop and ask the user to create a publishable token in the Rivet dashboard before running these checks.

\`@rivetkit/cli deploy\` waits for the managed pool to become ready before it exits, so a successful deploy means the deployment is already live. You do not need to poll deployment status separately.

The deployed app is served at its Rivet Run URL: \`${rivetRunUrl}\`. Open it in a browser to confirm the frontend loads, or verify the serverless runtime is up with \`curl ${rivetRunUrl}api/rivet/health\` (expects a 200).

If the deploy fails or you need to debug, read the deployment logs with the CLI (it resolves the token from \`~/.rivet/credentials\`):

\`\`\`bash
npx @rivetkit/cli logs --namespace ${namespace}
\`\`\`

Verify actors work end-to-end:

1. Create an actor. Actors require a key field (string, not array):
   \`\`\`bash
   curl -X POST "${apiUrl}/actors?namespace=${namespace}" \\
     -H "Authorization: Bearer ${publishableToken}" \\
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
     -d '{"name": "<ACTOR_NAME>", "key": "<KEY>", "runner_name_selector": "default", "crash_policy": "restart"}'
   \`\`\`
   Replace \`<ACTOR_NAME>\` with a valid actor name from the registry and \`<KEY>\` with an appropriate key string (e.g. "general"). Note the \`actor_id\` from the response.

2. Poll the actor's health endpoint through the gateway using the public token. Cold pools can take a while to start, so retry rather than sleeping a fixed amount:
   \`\`\`bash
   for i in $(seq 1 30); do
     curl -sf "${apiUrl}/gateway/<ACTOR_ID>/health" \\
       -H "x-rivet-token: ${publishableToken}" && break
     sleep 2
   done
   \`\`\`
   A successful run prints ok. If the loop finishes without output, treat it as a failure and move to step 3.

3. If the health check returns actor_runner_failed, check the logs to diagnose:
   \`\`\`bash
   npx @rivetkit/cli logs --namespace ${namespace}
   \`\`\`

4. Common issues:
   - "actor should have a key": The key field was missing from the create request.
   - Token 401: You are almost certainly using the \`cloud_api_*\` token where a \`pk_*\` token belongs, or the reverse. Also confirm the API URLs (${apiUrl}, ${cloudApiUrl}).
   - "Failed to start container: Please ensure your container starts successfully on the specified port (3000 if unspecified). Make sure your image was built for linux/amd64.": Ensure the container listens on \`RIVET_PORT\` (3000 by default) and that the \`--env PORT\` value passed to \`@rivetkit/cli deploy\` matches it.

## Troubleshooting

- Deployment and logs are done with \`npx @rivetkit/cli deploy\` and \`npx @rivetkit/cli logs\`. Both default to the \`production\` namespace, so always pass \`--namespace ${namespace}\`. Actor creation and health checks are done via HTTP APIs (curl) as shown in Step 5.
- Architecture: \`@rivetkit/cli deploy\` builds your Docker image and pushes it to Rivet. Rivet runs the container serverlessly. When you create an actor, Rivet communicates with the \`/api/rivet/*\` endpoint inside the container to manage its lifecycle.

Use \`@rivet-dev/workflows\` for durable, replayable multi-step operations. Keep external side effects inside named \`ctx.step(...)\` calls, use stable and unique step names, and model long-running work with workflow loops and queues where appropriate.

## Step 1: Understand the project

Determine whether the user wants a new workflow project or wants to add a workflow to the existing application. Inspect the current package manager, runtime, entrypoint, and deployment setup before editing.

## Step 2: Build the workflow

- Install \`@rivet-dev/workflows\` with the project's package manager.
- Define the workflow with \`workflow(...)\` and export a registry with \`setup({ use: { ... } })\`.
- Put retryable side effects in \`ctx.step("stable-step-name", ...)\` calls.
- Expose only the actions, queues, and state needed by the caller.
- Use \`rivetkit/client\` to create a typed client and exercise the workflow.
- Follow the current quickstart instead of substituting a generic Rivet Actor implementation.

## Step 3: Verify locally

Run the project, start one workflow instance, and verify its steps complete in order. Confirm the resulting state or action response, and exercise a queue when the workflow uses one. Report the commands run and the observed result.

## Step 4: Deploy

${deploySteps}

${mcpSection}After deployment, run the same workflow operation against the deployed environment and confirm the expected state. For troubleshooting, use https://rivet.dev/docs/actors/troubleshooting and include the workflow name, failed step name, runtime, and package version in the report.`;

- App deployment: https://rivet.dev/dynamic-apps/docs/deploy/
- Rivet connection: https://rivet.dev/dynamic-apps/docs/connect/

## Step 1: Understand the host

Determine whether the user wants a new Dynamic Apps host or wants to integrate Dynamic Apps into the existing server. Inspect the package manager, runtime, HTTP framework, authentication, and existing routes first.

## Step 2: Build the host

- Use Node.js 22 or newer.
- Install \`@rivet-dev/dynamic-apps\`, \`@hono/node-server\`, and \`hono\`.
- Create a Hono host that mounts the private Rivet callback with \`server.all("/api/rivet/*", (c) => appsRouter.fetch(c.req.raw))\`.
- Mount deployed applications with \`server.route("/apps", appsRouter)\` and serve the host on port 3000.
- Keep authentication and trusted control-plane routes in the host, outside generated application code.

Generated applications default-export a Fetch handler. They do not own an HTTP listener and must not call \`serve()\`, \`listen()\`, or \`registry.start()\`.

## Step 3: Generate and deploy an app

Use the supported Dynamic Apps skills when generating the file tree, then call \`deployApp({ appId, files })\` from trusted server-side code. For Rivet Cloud, keep \`RIVET_CLOUD_TOKEN\` server-side so \`deployApp()\` can create each app's isolated namespace.

Run the host, deploy a small app, and open \`http://localhost:3000/apps/<appId>/\`. Preserve the trailing slash and verify the generated app responds successfully. Do not replace this check with raw Rivet Actor creation or inspector calls.

## Step 4: Deploy the host${computeOwnsDeploy ? "" : ` to ${providerStr}`}

2. Deploy the Hono host as an HTTP service on port 3000, preserving both \`/api/rivet/*\` and \`/apps/*\` routes.
3. Set \`RIVET_CLOUD_TOKEN\` as a server-side secret when \`deployApp()\` will provision Rivet Cloud namespaces. For self-hosting, use the host's existing Rivet admin configuration instead.
4. Deploy a test app and verify it at the public \`/apps/<appId>/\` URL.`

Ask the user:

> Do you want to **build a new project with RivetKit**, or **integrate RivetKit into this existing project**?

Branch based on their answer.

---

## Path A: New project

### 1. Suggest something to build

Recommend something realtime, fast to spin up, and with a simple frontend. Good starting points:

- **Chat app** (rooms + messages, great default)
- Collaborative todo / list
- Live cursors / presence demo
- Simple multiplayer game (tic-tac-toe, drawing board)

Ask what they want to build. If they're unsure, default to a chat app.

### 2. Build it

Scaffold a minimal project with RivetKit:

- \`npm install rivetkit\` (or pnpm/yarn/whatever is being used)
- Add a frontend (plain HTML/JS or React via \`@rivetkit/react\` — keep it small).
- Define actors + registry (see https://rivet.dev/docs/actors).
- Serve via \`registry.listen({ port: Number(process.env.RIVET_PORT ?? 3000), publicDir: "<frontend-output-dir>" })\` so one command serves both API and frontend. Use 3000; the Dockerfile, \`--env PORT\`, and every health check below assume it.
- Add a local dev script (e.g. \`npm run dev\`) that builds the frontend and starts the server.

Reference quickstarts:
- Node.js / Bun: https://rivet.dev/docs/actors/quickstart/backend
- React: https://rivet.dev/docs/actors/quickstart/react

### 3. Verify

- \`GET /api/rivet/metadata\` returns 200.
- Drive actors via the inspector HTTP API: https://rivet.dev/docs/actors/debugging
- If there's a frontend, open it in a browser and confirm the realtime behavior works end-to-end.

### 4. Wrap up

Give the user:

- A brief overview of the project (what was built, where the actors live, how state/events flow).
- The command to run locally.
- Next steps to deploy + Rivet link.

**Deploy steps:**

## Path B: Integrate into existing project

### 1. Understand the project + propose

Read through the project to understand what it does. Then ask:

> What do you want to build, or how do you want to integrate RivetKit?

Give recommendations grounded in what you see. Examples:
- Chat app with video → move chat into a RivetKit actor for realtime + state.
- Todo app → per-list actor for collaborative editing.
- Dashboard → per-user actor for live metrics / presence.

### 2. Plan

Describe the plan before writing code:
- Which features become actors.
- What state each actor holds.
- Which actions + events the frontend will use.

Get confirmation before implementing.

### 3. Integrate (actors only)

- \`npm install rivetkit\`
- Add actors + registry (see https://rivet.dev/docs/actors).
${integrateStep}
- Do **not** touch the frontend yet unless the user asks.

${integrateVerify}

### 4. Wrap up

Give the user:
- A short overview of what was added.
- The command to run locally.

Then ask:

1. **Want to integrate this into the frontend?** Point at https://rivet.dev/docs/clients/react (or the relevant client doc) and wire it up if yes.
2. **Want to deploy?** If yes, **Deploy steps:**
