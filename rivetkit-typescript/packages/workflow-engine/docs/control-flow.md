# Control Flow

Workflow control flow is expressed through deterministic helpers on `WorkflowContextInterface`. These helpers create durable history entries, so the workflow can resume after crashes and restarts without re-running completed work.

## Overview

- Every control-flow operation has a durable name. Names must be unique within the current scope.
- Code outside of `ctx.step()` must be deterministic. Use steps for I/O and side effects.
- Avoid native loops; use `ctx.loop()` so iterations are replayable and checkpointed.

## Loops

Use `ctx.loop()` for repeatable logic with durable state, periodic checkpoints, and bounded history.

```ts
import { Loop, type WorkflowContextInterface } from "@rivetkit/workflow-engine";

async function processBatches(ctx: WorkflowContextInterface) {
  return await ctx.loop({
    name: "process-batches",
    state: { cursor: null as string | null, processed: 0 },
    commitInterval: 10,
    historyEvery: 10,
    historyKeep: 10,
    run: async (loopCtx, state) => {
      const batch = await loopCtx.step("fetch", () => fetchBatch(state.cursor));

      if (batch.items.length === 0) {
        return Loop.break(state.processed);
      }

      await loopCtx.step("process", () => processBatch(batch.items));

      return Loop.continue({
        cursor: batch.nextCursor,
        processed: state.processed + batch.items.length,
      });
    },
  });
}
```

Loop state is persisted every `commitInterval` iterations. Loop history is trimmed every `historyEvery` iterations, keeping only the most recent `historyKeep` iterations, so rollback only replays the last retained iteration.

## Join (Wait for All)

`ctx.join()` runs named branches in parallel and waits for all of them to complete. Branch errors are collected into a `JoinError`.

```ts
const results = await ctx.join("fetch-all", {
  user: { run: async (ctx) => ctx.step("user", () => fetchUser(id)) },
  posts: { run: async (ctx) => ctx.step("posts", () => fetchPosts(id)) },
});
```

- Branches run concurrently on the same workflow instance.
- All branches settle before `join` returns.
- Failures raise `JoinError` with per-branch errors.

## Race (First Wins)

`ctx.race()` runs branches in parallel and returns the first successful result. Losing branches are cancelled via `AbortSignal`.

```ts
const { winner, value } = await ctx.race("timeout", [
  { name: "work", run: async (ctx) => ctx.step("do-work", doWork) },
  { name: "timeout", run: async (ctx) => { await ctx.sleep("wait", 30000); return null; } },
]);
```

- The winner is persisted for replay.
- Losing branches receive `ctx.abortSignal` and typically throw `CancelledError`.
- If all branches fail, `RaceError` is thrown.

## Messages in Control Flow

`ctx.listen()` and its variants pause the workflow until a message arrives. Message names are part of history, so keep them stable and unique.

```ts
const approval = await ctx.listen<string>("approval", "approval-granted");
```

Messages are loaded at workflow start. If a message arrives during execution, the workflow yields and picks it up on the next run.

## Best Practices

- Use stable names for steps, loops, joins, races, and listens.
- Keep all nondeterministic work inside steps.
- Use loop state to avoid native `while`/`for` loops.
- Handle cancellation via `ctx.abortSignal` in long-running branches.
