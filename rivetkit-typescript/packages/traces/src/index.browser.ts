// Browser stub: createTraces is server-only (uses node:async_hooks, node:crypto,
// fdb-tuple). This module is selected via the "browser" export condition so that
// bundlers like Vite never pull in the real implementation when resolving
// @rivetkit/traces in a browser context.  The function is never actually called
// in the browser; it only exists because tsup chunk-splitting may place the
// import in a shared chunk also reached by client code.
