/// ## Based on FDB limitation
///
/// FDB starts having performance issues between 10k-100k keys in a single range read based on
/// rudimentary tests.
///
/// Can likely parallelize FDB transactions to return larger chunks.
///
/// ## Main limitation
///
/// FDB is the main limitation here, so we opt to use an FDB-friendly chunk size.
///
/// ## Estimated download time
///
/// Our current impl is incredily slow since we do not parallelize downloads.
///
/// Assume we have 10M keys with a 5k chunk size. This results in 2000 round trips.
///
/// If we have a latency of 200 ms (worst case), this takes 400 seconds total to propagate.
