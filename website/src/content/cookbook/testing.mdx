This page exists to validate cookbook-to-skill generation.

## Checklist

1. Prefer unit tests for pure logic (reducers, message handlers, validation).
2. Add integration tests for your Rivet Actor behaviors (actions and state transitions).
3. Add at least one end-to-end check that `/api/rivet/metadata` returns 200 in your dev server.
4. If you use realtime connections, test reconnect and hibernation behavior.

## Minimal Smoke Test

Run your backend in dev, then verify metadata:

```bash
curl -fsS http://localhost:3000/api/rivet/metadata >/dev/null
echo "ok"
```
