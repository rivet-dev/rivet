# Deploying to Vercel

Deploy your RivetKit app to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisites">

- [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/)
- Your RivetKit app
  - If you don't have one, see the [Quickstart](/docs/actors/quickstart) page or our [Examples](https://github.com/rivet-dev/rivet/tree/main/examples)
- Access to the [Rivet Cloud](https://dashboard.rivet.dev/) or a [self-hosted Rivet Engine](/docs/general/self-hosting)

</Step>
<Step title="Prepare Your Application">

Make sure your project is configured correctly for Vercel deployment.

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Next.js">

Your Next.js project should have the following structure:

- `src/app/api/rivet/[...all]/route.ts`: RivetKit route handler
- `src/actors.ts`: Actor definitions and registry

See the [Next.js quickstart](/docs/actors/quickstart/next-js) or the [Next.js template](/templates/next-js) to get started.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Hono">

Your Hono project needs:

1. A `vercel.json` file with the Hono framework specified:

```json {{"title":"vercel.json"}}
{
  "framework": "hono"
}
```

2. Your server file must import from `"hono"` for Vercel to recognize the framework:

```ts {{"title":"src/server.ts"}}
// You MUST import from "hono" for Vercel to detect this as a Hono app
import { Hono } from "hono";
import { registry } from "./actors.ts";

const app = new Hono();
app.all("/api/rivet/*", (c) => registry.handler(c.req.raw));
export default app;
```

3. Use `.ts` file extensions in imports and configure your `tsconfig.json`:

```json {{"title":"tsconfig.json"}}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "rewriteRelativeImportExtensions": true
  }
}
```

See the [Hello World template](/templates/hello-world) for a complete example.

For more details on Hono deployments, see [Vercel's Hono documentation](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/backend/hono).

</Tab>

<Tab title="Other">

Vercel currently supports Next.js and Hono frameworks for RivetKit deployments.

For other frameworks, consider deploying to [Railway](/docs/connect/railway), [Kubernetes](/docs/connect/kubernetes), or another platform.

</Step>
<Step title="Deploy to Vercel">

1. Connect your GitHub project to Vercel
2. Select your repository containing your RivetKit app
3. Vercel will deploy your app

More information on deployments are available in [Vercel's docs](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments).

</Step>
<Step title="Connect and Verify">

1. Visit the [Rivet dashboard](https://dashboard.rivet.dev)
2. Navigate to _Connect > Vercel_
3. Skip to the _Deploy to Vercel_ step
4. Input your deployed Vercel site URL
	- e.g. `https://my-app.vercel.app/api/rivet`
5. Once it shows as successfully connected, click _Done_

Your Vercel Functions deployment is now connected to Rivet.
