# Deploying to Railway
#
Deploy your RivetKit app to [Railway](https://railway.app).

## Option A: Deploy from Template

If you're starting from scratch, go to the Connect tab on the Rivet dashboard and follow the Railway deployment steps. This give you a 1-click deploy of the [RivetKit Railway template]().

## Option B: Deploy Manual

<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisites">

- [Railway account](https://railway.app)
- Your RivetKit app
  - If you don't have one, see the [Quickstart](/docs/actors/quickstart) page or our [Examples](https://github.com/rivet-dev/rivet/tree/main/examples)
- Access to the [Rivet Cloud](https://dashboard.rivet.dev/) or a [self-hosted Rivet Engine](/docs/general/self-hosting)

</Step>
<Step title="Setup Project for Railway">

Ensure your `package.json` has a start script:

```json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  }
  // ... Rest of package.json
}
```
</Step>
<Step title="Deploy to Railway">

1. Connect your GitHub account to Railway
2. Select your repository containing your RivetKit app
3. Railway will automatically detect and deploy your app

Railway will automatically deploy your RivetKit app on every git push.

Detailed steps are available on [Railway's docs](https://docs.railway.com/quick-start).

<Note>You do not need to expose a container port. Rivet tunnels traffic directly to your backend.</Note>
</Step>
<Step title="Set Environment Variables">

After selecting your project on the Rivet dashboard, go to Connect > Railway to get the environment variables needed.

To add your environment variables:
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Select your service
3. Navigate to the **Variables** tab
4. Add the required environment variables and deploy your changes

Detailed steps are available on [Railway's docs](https://docs.railway.com/guides/variables#service-variables).
</Step>
<Step title="Verify Deployment">

You should see your runner connected on the Connect tab of your Rivet Dashboard. Now you can create and connect to your Rivet Actors.
