## Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisites">

- Your RivetKit app
  - If you don't have one, see the [Quickstart](/docs/actors/quickstart) page or our [Examples](https://github.com/rivet-dev/rivet/tree/main/examples)
- Access to the [Rivet Cloud](https://dashboard.rivet.dev/) or a [self-hosted Rivet Engine](/docs/general/self-hosting)
- A hosting platform that supports running Node.js applications with HTTP endpoints

</Step>
<Step title="Deploy Your App">

Deploy your RivetKit app to your hosting platform of choice. The specific steps will vary depending on your platform, but ensure:

1. Your app is built and deployed
2. The `/api/rivet` endpoint is publicly accessible
3. Your app can receive incoming HTTP requests

</Step>
<Step title="Set Environment Variables">

After creating your project on the Rivet dashboard, select "Custom" as your provider. You'll be provided two environment variables to configure in your hosting platform:

- `RIVET_ENDPOINT` - The endpoint for your app to communicate with Rivet
- `RIVET_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` - The public endpoint for clients to connect to actors

Add these environment variables to your hosting platform's configuration.

</Step>
<Step title="Connect to Rivet">

1. Ensure your app is accessible via a public URL
2. On the Rivet dashboard, paste your URL with the `/api/rivet` path into the connect form (e.g. `https://my-app.example.com/api/rivet`)
3. Click "Done"

</Step>
</Steps>

## Requirements

Your hosting platform must support:

- **HTTP endpoints** - Your app must be reachable via a public URL
- **Environment variables** - To configure the Rivet connection
- **Persistent processes or serverless functions** - To handle incoming requests to the `/api/rivet` endpoint

## Troubleshooting

### Connection fails

- Verify your app is publicly accessible
- Check that the `/api/rivet` endpoint returns a valid response
- Ensure environment variables are correctly set

### Actors not responding

- Confirm `RIVET_ENDPOINT` and `RIVET_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` are both configured
- Check your hosting platform's logs for connection errors
