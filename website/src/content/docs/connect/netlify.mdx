## Steps

<Steps>
<Step title="Prerequisites">

- [Netlify account](https://netlify.com/)
- Your RivetKit app
  - If you don't have one, see the [Quickstart](/docs/actors/quickstart) page or our [Examples](https://github.com/rivet-dev/rivet/tree/main/examples)
- Access to the [Rivet Cloud](https://dashboard.rivet.dev/) or a [self-hosted Rivet Engine](/docs/general/self-hosting)

</Step>
<Step title="Prepare Your Application">

Make sure your project is configured correctly for Netlify deployment.

<Tabs>

<Tab title="Next.js">

Your Next.js project should have the following structure:

- `src/app/api/rivet/[...all]/route.ts`: RivetKit route handler
- `src/actors.ts`: Actor definitions and registry

Configure your Next.js project for Netlify by installing the Netlify adapter:

```bash
npm install @netlify/plugin-nextjs
```

Add a `netlify.toml` file:

```toml {{"title":"netlify.toml"}}
[build]
  command = "npm run build"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

[functions]
  node_bundler = "esbuild"
```

See the [Next.js quickstart](/docs/actors/quickstart/next-js) to get started with a Next.js + RivetKit app.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Netlify Functions">

Your Netlify Functions project needs:

1. A `netlify.toml` file with the functions configuration:

```toml {{"title":"netlify.toml"}}
[build]
  functions = "functions"
  publish = "dist"

[functions]
  node_bundler = "esbuild"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/rivet/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/rivet"
  status = 200
```

2. Your function handler in the `functions/` directory:

```ts {{"title":"functions/rivet.ts"}} @nocheck
import type { Handler } from "@netlify/functions";
import { registry } from "../src/actors.ts";

export const handler: Handler = async (event, context) => {
  const { httpMethod, path, queryStringParameters, headers, body } = event;
  
  // Convert Netlify event to standard Request
  const url = `https://${headers.host}${path}${
    queryStringParameters 
      ? '?' + new URLSearchParams(queryStringParameters).toString() 
      : ''
  }`;
  
  const request = new Request(url, {
    method: httpMethod,
    headers: headers as HeadersInit,
    body: body ? body : undefined,
  });

  const response = await registry.handler(request);
  
  // Convert Response to Netlify format
  const responseHeaders: Record<string, string> = {};
  response.headers.forEach((value, key) => {
    responseHeaders[key] = value;
  });

  return {
    statusCode: response.status,
    headers: responseHeaders,
    body: await response.text(),
  };
};
```

3. Use `.ts` file extensions in imports and configure your `tsconfig.json`:

```json {{"title":"tsconfig.json"}}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "allowImportingTsExtensions": true,
    "rewriteRelativeImportExtensions": true,
    "target": "ES2020",
    "lib": ["ES2020"],
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "bundler"
  }
}
```

See the [Hello World template](/templates/hello-world) for a complete example.

<Tab title="Other">

Netlify supports many frameworks through build plugins and adapters:

- **Astro**: Use `@astrojs/netlify` adapter
- **SvelteKit**: Use `@sveltejs/adapter-netlify` 
- **Nuxt**: Use `@nuxtjs/netlify-builder`
- **Remix**: Use `@netlify/remix-adapter`

For frameworks not listed above, you can usually deploy using Netlify Functions with the patterns shown in the "Netlify Functions" tab.

</Step>
<Step title="Deploy to Netlify">

1. Connect your Git repository to Netlify:
   - Visit [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) and sign in
   - Click "Add new site" > "Import an existing project"
   - Connect your Git provider and select your repository

2. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: Usually auto-detected based on your framework
   - Publish directory: Usually auto-detected (e.g., `dist`, `build`, `.next`)
   - Functions directory: Set to `functions` if using Netlify Functions

3. Deploy your site:
   - Netlify will automatically build and deploy your app
   - You'll receive a unique Netlify URL (e.g., `https://amazing-app-123456.netlify.app`)

More information on deployments is available in [Netlify's docs](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/create-deploys/).

</Step>
<Step title="Set Environment Variables">

1. In your Netlify site dashboard, go to **Site settings > Environment variables**
2. Add the following environment variables (provided after creating your project in the Rivet dashboard):
   - `RIVET_ENDPOINT`: Your Rivet backend endpoint
   - `RIVET_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT`: Your frontend-safe Rivet endpoint
   - `RIVET_TOKEN`: Your Rivet authentication token

3. Redeploy your site to apply the environment variables

See [Netlify's environment variables docs](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/environment-variables/) for more details.

</Step>
<Step title="Connect and Verify">

1. Visit the [Rivet dashboard](https://dashboard.rivet.dev)
2. Navigate to _Connect > Netlify_
3. Skip to the _Deploy to Netlify_ step
4. Input your deployed Netlify site URL
	- e.g. `https://amazing-app-123456.netlify.app/api/rivet`
5. Once it shows as successfully connected, click _Done_

Your Netlify Functions deployment is now connected to Rivet.
