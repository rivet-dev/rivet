## Getting Started

See the [Next.js quickstart guide](/docs/actors/quickstart/next-js) for getting started.

## API Reference

It's the same as the [React client API reference](https://rivet.dev/docs/clients/react#api-reference), since the RivetKit React package is used in both Next.js and React applications.
