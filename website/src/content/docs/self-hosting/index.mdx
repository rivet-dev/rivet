# Self-Hosting Overview

Self-hosting Rivet gives you complete control over the actor orchestration platform and infrastructure.

## Self-Host vs BYOC

<img alt="Rivet BYOC vs self-hosting" src={imgByocVsSelfHost.src} />

Rivet supports both BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) and self-hosting to fit your deployment needs.

| | Self-Hosting | BYOC with Rivet Cloud |
|---|---|---|
| **You Manage** | Full stack (your backend, engine, Rivet Engine, database) | Only your backend |
| **Complexity** | Higher (full stack deployment) | Lower (connect and deploy) |
| **Cost** | Higher operational overhead | Usually lower usage-based cost |
| **Supports Serverless** | Requires extra infrastructure | Yes |
| **Air-Gapped Deployments** | Yes | No |
| **Best For** | Air-gapped environments, strict compliance, custom security policies | All other production deployments |
| **Support** | [Contact sales](/sales) or community | Community, Slack, and email (varies by plan) |
| **Documentation** | Continue below | [See connect guides](/docs/connect) |

## Architecture
#
<img alt="Rivet self-hosting architecture" src={imgArch.src} />

Rivet has 3 core components:

- **Your Backend**: Your application server that handles user requests and includes a runner component that executes actor code
- **Rivet Engine**: Main orchestration service that manages actor lifecycle, routes messages, and provides APIs
- **Storage**: Persistence layer for actor state and messaging infrastructure for real-time communication


## Storage Backends

Rivet supports multiple storage backends:

- **File System**: Suitable for single-node deployments
- **PostgreSQL**: Recommended for production
- **FoundationDB**: For massive scale ([requires enterprise](/sales))
