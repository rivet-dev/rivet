# Connections

Connections represent client connections to your actor. They provide a way to handle client authentication, manage connection-specific data, and control the connection lifecycle.

For documentation on connecting to actors from clients, see the [Clients documentation](/docs/actors/clients).

## Parameters

When clients connect to an actor, they can pass connection parameters that are handled during the connection process.

For example:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript {{"title":"Client"}}
import { createClient } from "rivetkit/client";
import type { registry } from "./src/index";

const client = createClient<typeof registry>("http://localhost:8080");
const gameRoom = await client.gameRoom.get({
  params: { authToken: "supersekure" }
});
```

```typescript {{"title":"Actor"}}
import { actor } from "rivetkit";

interface ConnParams {
  authToken: string;
}

interface ConnState {
  userId: string;
  role: string;
}

const gameRoom = actor({
  state: {},

  // Handle connection setup
  createConnState: (c, opts, params: ConnParams): ConnState => {
    // Validate authentication token
    const authToken = params.authToken;

    if (!authToken || !validateToken(authToken)) {
      throw new Error("Invalid auth token");
    }

    // Create connection state
    return { userId: getUserIdFromToken(authToken), role: "player" };
  },
  
  actions: {
    // ...
  }
});
```


</CodeGroup>

## Connection State

There are two ways to define an actor's connection state:

<Tabs>
	<Tab title="connState">
		Define connection state as a constant value:

		```typescript
		import { actor } from "rivetkit";

		const chatRoom = actor({
		  state: { messages: [] },

		  // Define default connection state as a constant
		  connState: {
		    role: "guest",
		    joinedAt: 0
		  },

		  onConnect: (c) => {
		    // Update join timestamp when a client connects
		    c.conn.state.joinedAt = Date.now();
		  },

		  actions: {
		    // ...
		  }
		});
		```

		This value will be cloned for every new connection using `structuredClone`.
	</Tab>

	<Tab title="createConnState">
		Create connection state dynamically with a function called for each connection:

		```typescript
		import { actor } from "rivetkit";

		interface ConnState {
		  userId: string;
		  role: string;
		  joinedAt: number;
		}

		const chatRoom = actor({
		  state: { messages: [] },

		  // Create connection state dynamically
		  createConnState: (c): ConnState => {
		    // Validate any connection parameters
		    // ...

		    // Return the connection state
		    return {
		      userId: generateUserId(),
		      role: "guest",
		      joinedAt: Date.now()
		    };
		  },

		  actions: {
		    sendMessage: (c, message) => {
		      const username = c.conn.state.userId;
		      c.state.messages.push({ username, message });
		      c.broadcast("newMessage", { username, message });
		    }
		  }
		});
		```
	</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Connection Lifecycle Hooks

The connection lifecycle has several hooks:

- `onBeforeConnect`: Called before a client connects, returns the connection state
- `onConnect`: Called when a client successfully connects
- `createState`: Called when creating a connection state
- `onDisconnect`: Called when a client disconnects

See the documentation on [Actor Lifecycle](/docs/actors/lifecycle) for more details.

## Connection List

All active connections can be accessed through the context object's `conns` property. This is an array of all current connections.

This is frequently used with `conn.send(name, event)` to send messages directly to clients. To send an event to all connections at once, use `c.broadcast()` instead. See [Events](/docs/actors/events) for more details on broadcasting.

For example:

```typescript
import { actor } from "rivetkit";

const chatRoom = actor({
  state: { users: {} },
  
  actions: {
    sendDirectMessage: (c, recipientId, message) => {
      // Find the recipient's connection
      const recipientConn = c.conns.find(conn => conn.state.userId === recipientId);
      
      if (recipientConn) {
        // Send a private message to just that client
        recipientConn.send("directMessage", {
          from: c.conn.state.userId,
          message: message
        });
      }
    }
  }
});
```

<Note>
`conn.send()` has no effect on [low-level WebSocket connections](/docs/actors/websocket-handler). For low-level WebSockets, use the WebSocket API directly (e.g., `websocket.send()`).
</Note>

## Disconnecting clients

Connections can be disconnected from within an action:

```typescript
import { actor } from "rivetkit";

const secureRoom = actor({
  state: {},
  
  actions: {
    kickUser: (c, targetUserId, reason) => {
      // Find the connection to kick
      const targetConn = c.conns.find(conn => conn.state.userId === targetUserId);
      
      if (targetConn) {
        // Disconnect with a reason
        targetConn.disconnect(reason || "Kicked by admin");
      }
    }
  }
});
```

If you need to wait for the disconnection to complete, you can use `await`:

```typescript
await c.conn.disconnect("Too many requests");
```

This ensures the underlying network connections close cleanly before continuing.
