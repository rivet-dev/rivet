## Rivet Cloud

### Namespace & Project Archive
Projects and namespaces can now be archived directly from the dashboard. Archived resources are hidden from the default view but can be restored at any time.
## Sandbox Agent

### OpenCode Support
Sandbox Agent now supports [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) as an adapter, expanding the range of AI coding assistants that can be orchestrated through the universal agent API.

### Gigacode Launch for Sandbox Agent SDK
Gigacode allows you to use OpenCode UI with any coding agent, built into Sandbox Agent SDK. This isn't a fork of Opencode.


### ARM Builds
Native ARM64 Docker images are now published for Sandbox Agent, enabling efficient deployment on Apple Silicon Macs, AWS Graviton, and other ARM-based infrastructure without emulation overhead.

### Embedded UI
The Sandbox Agent UI is now bundled directly into the agent binary. No separate frontend deployment required—just run the agent and access the inspector UI at the configured port.

## CI/CD

### GitHub Preview CI
Improved GitHub Actions workflow for preview deployments, enabling faster iteration on pull requests with automatic preview environments.
