Your docs are riddled with errors, you just don't realize it.

- Humans are horrible at writing code
- Agents make shit up in your docs all the time, it's aweful

## What happens when an agent runs in to docs with errors

- TODO

## Why it's so bad

It's 2022. Cursor hasn't taken over. Humans are still the primary users of your product.

## How to do this

You can probalby one shot this with your agent.

This is the architecture that we have set up:

TODO

This is the prompt I used to one shot this with Astro:

```
TODO: Prompt
```

Then have the agent fix all the errors.

<Tip>
	If you write Rust or Swift, you're lucky

	TODO: Rustdoc does this for you
