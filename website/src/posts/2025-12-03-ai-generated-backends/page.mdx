# Generating AI & User Generated Backends with Rivet

We are launching an easier way for AI and users to generate backends with Rivet.

## The Challenge of AI-Generated Backends

When building backends for AI-generated applications or enabling users to "vibe-code" their own logic, developers often face a complex orchestration problem. You need to manage HTTP servers, provision databases, handle real-time infrastructure (WebSockets), and ensure everything is secure and scalable. This disjointed architecture is difficult for humans to manage and even harder for AI to generate correct, bug-free code for.

## Rivet's Solution

Rivet simplifies this by consolidating everything into a single model: **Rivet Actors**.

We're introducing a new way to build backends that checks all the boxes for AI-generated and user-generated applications:

### ✔️ Built-in Real-time
Rivet Actors have WebSocket support baked in. There's no need to set up a separate WebSocket server or worry about scaling connections. The AI simply defines how to handle messages, and Rivet handles the rest.

### ✔️ Per-Tenant Database
Every actor has its own isolated state and storage. This effectively gives you a per-tenant database without the management overhead. Data is co-located with the logic, ensuring low latency and simplifying data access patterns.

### ✔️ Consolidated State & Logic
Logic and state live together in the same actor. This simplifies the mental model significantly. Instead of reasoning about stateless functions updating a remote database, the AI can reason about a single stateful object that persists its changes.

### ✔️ Easier for AI to Understand
By removing the need to juggle separate HTTP endpoints, database schemas, and infrastructure configuration, Rivet provides a cleaner abstraction. This "single unit" approach reduces the likelihood of hallucinations and integration bugs, making it much easier for AI models to generate working, production-ready backends.

## Why Rivet Actors?

Rivet Actors are the perfect primitive for this use case. An actor is a stateful, isolated unit of logic that can persist data and handle real-time connections. When an AI generates a backend, it simply defines an Actor class with the necessary state and methods.

Rivet handles the heavy lifting:
- **Deployment**: Actors are deployed instantly.
- **Scaling**: Rivet scales actors based on demand.
- **Networking**: Built-in routing and WebSocket handling.

This allows the AI to focus on the *business logic* rather than the *infrastructure plumbing*.

## Partnering with Freestyle

We are excited to announce that we are partnering with [Freestyle](https://freestyle.sh) to offer a template for building these apps.

Freestyle provides a cloud platform for running AI-generated code with built-in security and scalability. Together with Rivet, you can build powerful, real-time, stateful applications that are entirely generated by AI.

This partnership brings together the best of both worlds: Rivet's stateful actor model and Freestyle's secure execution environment for generated code.
