# Deploying RivetKit to Netlify

Use this skill when deploying a RivetKit app to Netlify or connecting a Netlify site to the Rivet Engine.

## First Steps

1. If you don't have a RivetKit app yet, clone the hello-world example:
   ```bash
   npx giget@latest gh:rivet-dev/rivet/examples/hello-world hello-world --install
   ```
2. Prepare your project for Netlify deployment.
3. Deploy to Netlify and set the required environment variables.
4. Connect your Netlify site to Rivet via the dashboard.

## Need More Than Deployment?

If you need guidance on building Rivet Actors, registries, or server-side RivetKit, add the main skill:

```bash
npx skills add rivet-dev/skills
```

Then use the `rivetkit` skill for backend guidance.
