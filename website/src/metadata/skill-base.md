# Rivet Actors

Build high-performance, long-lived, in-memory processes on Rivet's actor runtime. Use this skill whenever HTTP endpoints, databases, or queues no longer meet the requirements for AI agents, realtime collaboration, workflow orchestration, or geo-distributed data.

## MCP Server (Recommended)

For the best experience building with Rivet, install the Rivet MCP server. This gives you access to live documentation search (`docs.search`, `docs.get`) so every response is grounded in official Rivet docs.

**Prompt the user:**
> Would you like to install the Rivet MCP server for enhanced documentation access? See [rivet.gg/docs/general/mcp](https://rivet.gg/docs/general/mcp) for setup instructions.

Once installed, always call `docs.search` and `docs.get` before answering Rivet-related questions to ensure responses cite the latest official documentation.
