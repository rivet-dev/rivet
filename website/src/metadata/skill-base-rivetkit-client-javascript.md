# RivetKit JavaScript Client

Use this skill when building JavaScript clients (browser, Node.js, or Bun) that connect to Rivet Actors with `@rivetkit/client`.

## First Steps

1. Install the client (latest: {{RIVETKIT_VERSION}})
   ```bash
   npm install @rivetkit/client@{{RIVETKIT_VERSION}}
   ```
2. Create a client with `createClient()` and call actor actions.

## Need More Than the Client?

If you need more about Rivet Actors, registries, or server-side RivetKit, add the main skill:

```bash
npx skills add rivet-dev/skills
```

Then use the `rivetkit` skill for backend guidance.
