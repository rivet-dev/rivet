# Express Integration

Example project demonstrating Express web framework integration.

## Getting Started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rivet-dev/rivet.git
cd rivet/examples/express
npm install
npm run dev
```


## Features

- **Express web framework**: Use Express for HTTP routing and middleware with actors
- **Familiar API**: Standard Express patterns and middleware work seamlessly
- **Actor integration**: Call actor actions from Express route handlers
- **Type-safe communication**: TypeScript support for actor method calls

## Implementation

This example demonstrates integrating Express web framework with Rivet Actors:

- **Actor Definition** ([`src/backend/registry.ts`](https://github.com/rivet-dev/rivet/tree/main/examples/express/src/backend/registry.ts)): Shows how to use Express middleware and routing with actors
