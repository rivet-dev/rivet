Build a vanilla JavaScript counter application backed by a RivetKit actor.

Requirements:
- A single counter actor that stores count in state
- An `increment` action that adds to the count
- A vanilla JS frontend (no React) with an HTML page that displays the count and has a + button
- Use Vite for the dev server
- Use the file-system driver (standalone mode, no external server)
- The app should run with `npm run dev` on port 5173
