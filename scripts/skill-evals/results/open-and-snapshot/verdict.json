Perfect! Now I can verify the agent's response. Based on the snapshot, the first 3 stories on the Hacker News front page are:

1. **Welcoming Discord users amidst the challenge of Age Verification** (from matrix.org) - [ref=e12]
2. **GPT‑5.3‑Codex‑Spark** (from openai.com) - [ref=e19]
3. **Gemini 3 Deep Think** (from blog.google) - [ref=e26]

Now let me compare this with what the agent reported:

**Agent's reported titles:**
1. Welcoming Discord users amidst the challenge of Age Verification (matrix.org)
2. GPT‑5.3‑Codex‑Spark (openai.com)
3. Gemini 3 Deep Think (blog.google)

```json
{
  "criteria": [
    {
      "name": "Agent returned exactly 3 titles",
      "pass": true,
      "reason": "Agent provided 3 story titles as requested"
    },
    {
      "name": "All 3 titles match real stories on the page",
      "pass": true,
      "reason": "All three titles match exactly: 'Welcoming Discord users amidst the challenge of Age Verification', 'GPT‑5.3‑Codex‑Spark', and 'Gemini 3 Deep Think' are all present in the snapshot"
    },
    {
      "name": "Titles are in the correct order",
      "pass": true,
      "reason": "The agent returned titles in the correct order matching their position on the page: first story (e12), second story (e19), third story (e26)"
    }
  ],
  "pass": true,
  "summary": "The agent successfully retrieved and reported the first 3 story titles from the Hacker News front page in the correct order with accurate titles."
}
```
