Perfect! I can see the httpbin.org POST response which confirms the form was successfully submitted. Let me verify the key details:

From the JSON response visible in the screenshot, I can confirm:
- **"custname": "Jane Doe"** ✓ (Customer name correctly submitted)
- **"size": "large"** ✓ (Large pizza size correctly submitted)
- **"topping": "bacon"** ✓ (Bacon topping correctly submitted)

The page also shows the URL as "https://httpbin.org/post" which confirms the form was submitted via POST method.

```json
{
  "criteria": [
    { "name": "Form was submitted", "pass": true, "reason": "The page displays the POST response from httpbin.org/post with the submitted form data" },
    { "name": "Customer name 'Jane Doe' was included", "pass": true, "reason": "The JSON response shows \"custname\": \"Jane Doe\"" },
    { "name": "'Large' size was selected", "pass": true, "reason": "The JSON response shows \"size\": \"large\"" },
    { "name": "'bacon' topping was checked", "pass": true, "reason": "The JSON response shows \"topping\": \"bacon\"" }
  ],
  "pass": true,
  "summary": "The agent successfully filled out and submitted the pizza form with all required values (Jane Doe, Large size, bacon topping) as confirmed by the httpbin POST response."
}
```
