@prd.md @progress.txt

Work on exactly ONE feature, then STOP.

1. Decide which task to work on next (highest priority, not necessarily first in list)
2. Implement that ONE feature
3. Run type checks and tests
4. Append progress to progress.txt
5. Make a git commit
6. STOP IMMEDIATELY - do not start another task

If all work is complete, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>

CRITICAL: After committing, you are DONE. Do not look for more work. Do not start the next feature. Just stop.

Never ask questions or request clarification.
